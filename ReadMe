Uploading pdf Problems

Multer Cons
> It will also use file system to store which is time comsuming.
> Will slow down server in case of many files storage.cd

Direct URL to model
> Is not competible with google drive links.

FS module in node
> Have to provide an absolute path to the file so cannot work online.
> Have to store file in backend and provide path to model to make it work online.

For large files best strategy is to upload files on cloud and provide the url to model

In my case max file size I am keeping is 20 mb and i have no cloud service available so I will go with multer.
